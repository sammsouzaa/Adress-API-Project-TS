# Food API Project

Welcome to the Food API Project repository! This project was developed as part of the "Programação para Internet" (Web Programming) course. It involves creating a RESTful API for managing food-related data using technologies such as Yarn, TypeScript, Mongoose, and Node.js modules.

## Features
- RESTful API for managing food-related data.
- Developed using Yarn as a package manager, TypeScript for type-safe development, and Mongoose for MongoDB integration.
- Implementation includes models, routes, and various Node.js modules for a modular and organized codebase.

## Technology Stack
- Yarn
- TypeScript
- Mongoose (MongoDB)
- Node.js modules

## Code Overview
The project structure includes models for defining data structures, routes for handling API endpoints, and various Node.js modules for functionality. TypeScript ensures type safety throughout the development process.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have Yarn installed on your system.
3. Run `yarn install` to install the project dependencies.
4. Configure MongoDB connection details in the appropriate file.
5. Run `yarn start` to start the Node.js server.

## API Endpoints
- `/api/foods`: Retrieve all foods.
- `/api/foods/:id`: Retrieve a specific food by ID.
- `/api/foods/create`: Create a new food entry.
- `/api/foods/:id/update`: Update an existing food entry.
- `/api/foods/:id/delete`: Delete a food entry.
